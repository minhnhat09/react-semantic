      "back": "A directed graph is weakly connected if it would be connected by ignoring the direction of edges. Thus, a weakly connected graph consists of a single piece. A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path between every pair of vertices. This distinction is best made clear by considering the network of one- and two-way streets in any city. The network is strongly connected if it is possible to drive legally between every two positions. The network is weakly connected when it is possible to drive legally or illegally between every two positions. The network is disconnected if there is no possible way to drive from a to b.",
